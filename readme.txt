Useful extensions for your WordPress website.

== Description ==

WordPress is a great platform and a good basis. But it needs plugins to add functions, which is necessary for almost every website. The aim of this plugin is to add very useful extensions to your WordPress website.

**Here is a list of the current functions:**

- Extra fields: It gives a central place, where you can add your basic informations, like name, address, phone or email. Use shortcodes to add these informations to your site. If you ever need to change any of this information, you can change it in one place and all your informations will automatically update. Wow!
- Google Analytics: An easy way to use Google Analytics tracking on your website. You only need to add your UA code and everything is done automatically. You can add your Classic or your Universal Analytics code and you can set display features option, if you want.
- Google Tag Manager: The best way to manage all your 3rd party codes on your website.
- Social share buttons for posts with 5 different styles: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Email
- Shortcodes: A lot of useful shortcodes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this plugin good for? =

I am managing hundreds of client websites. I use only the best and mostly premium plugins for their sites, but their are some missing functions, which are very useful for a lot of websites. This was the original reason for this plugin to born. It can add these missing functions. It means this plugin will have more and more functions in the future.
